# Lovable Knowledge Base (project-level projection)

Paste this into a Lovable project's **Knowledge Base** (Project settings). Lovable does
not read the repo, so this is a *projection* of the brain — regenerate it when the
canonical files change. Keep it tight; Lovable applies it on every prompt.

## Project
Orbit by Efficio — enterprise procurement software (ClauseIQ, MarketIQ, RFP Analytics,
RFP Builder). B2B, data-dense, long working sessions. Not a consumer app or marketing site.

## Platform split
Before designing, identify the platform:
- Connected Platform = internal Efficio users.
- Orbit / Client Connected Platform = external client users.

Use `design-brain/platforms/connected-platform.md` or
`design-brain/platforms/orbit-client-connected-platform.md` as the platform profile.
Do not mix internal Connected Platform visual patterns or terminology into external
client-facing Orbit screens.

## Design principles (from principles.md)
Density over whitespace; scannability over delight; predictability over novelty; honest
system state; progressive disclosure; restraint. Default comfortable density; support compact.

## Tokens / theme (from tokens.md)
- Use semantic/component design tokens only; never hardcode colours, spacing, radii,
  type, shadow, or z-index.
- Source repo: `/Users/derekwong/efficio-orbit`.
- Token bundle: `packages/orbit/tokens.css`.
- Token sources: `packages/orbit/styles/tokens/`.
- Base Efficio / CP theme lives on `:root`; Orbit overrides live in
  `packages/orbit/styles/tokens/themes/orbit.css` under `[data-theme="orbit"]`.
- Useful token families: `--orbit-color-text-*`, `--orbit-color-border-*`,
  `--orbit-color-bg-*`, `--orbit-space-*`, `--orbit-text-*`,
  `--orbit-radius-*`, `--orbit-shadow-*`, `--orbit-z-*`,
  `--orbit-color-btn-*`, `--orbit-color-card-*`, `--orbit-dropdown-*`,
  `--orbit-tab-*`, `--orbit-color-status-*`.

## Components
Reuse the Orbit component library. Do not invent generic ShadCN-styled components.
Start with these source-backed contracts:
- `data-table` = Orbit `Table`
- `button` = Orbit `Button` / `IconButton`
- `input` = Orbit `Input`
- `select-combobox` = Orbit `Dropdown` / `MultiSelectDropdown`
- `dialog` = Orbit `Overlay`
- `toast-notification` = Orbit `Toast`
- `tabs` = Orbit `TabButton` / `PageHeader` tabs
- `badge-status` = Orbit `Badge`
- `card-panel` = Orbit `Card`
- `drawer` = gap; reusable source not found. Use `Overlay` for modal behavior.

ClauseIQ is the current real product-style precedent:
`apps/prototypes/components/feature/clauseiq/ClauseIQPrototype.tsx`.

Reference or paste the relevant contract before asking Lovable to build a screen.

## Non-negotiables
- WCAG 2.2 AA: keyboard operable, visible focus, AA contrast, not colour-alone.
- Every component: default/hover/focus/active/disabled/loading/empty/error.
- Copy: verb-led actions, plain professional voice, real recovery in errors.
- Motion: fast, functional, respects reduced-motion.
- Do NOT ship the default ShadCN/Tailwind look.
- Do NOT use benchmark/docs screenshots as product visual truth.
- Do NOT invent a Drawer API until the design-system owners approve one.

## Prime before building
Start a session with: "Before writing code, review this Knowledge Base and summarise
the Orbit constraints you'll follow." Then build.

## Port back to Orbit
Lovable output is a prototype until it passes the `port-to-orbit` workflow:
inventory components, map to Orbit contracts, translate literals to semantic tokens,
add missing states, verify accessibility, and check both themes/densities.

Known successful port benchmark: `/Users/derekwong/Downloads/Test` was translated into
`/Users/derekwong/efficio-orbit/apps/docs/app/design-system/benchmarks/lovable-port/`
with Orbit `PageHeader`, `Table`, `Searchbox`, `Dropdown`, `Button`, `Badge`, `Card`,
`Text`, `Headings`, and `FaIcon`. Future Lovable work should follow the same mapping
pattern and report any component gaps instead of importing ShadCN/Tailwind defaults.

# Golden Example: Lovable Initiatives Prototype Port

## Demonstrates
- `lovable-port` pattern applied to a real Lovable/ShadCN/Tailwind prototype.
- External table workflow preserved while visual system, states, accessibility, and
  density are rebuilt with Orbit.
- Component mapping and token translation that future prototype ports can copy.

## Real Source Links
- Source prototype root:
  `/Users/derekwong/Downloads/Test`
- Source prototype table:
  `/Users/derekwong/Downloads/Test/src/components/initiatives-table.tsx`
- Source prototype styles:
  `/Users/derekwong/Downloads/Test/src/styles.css`
- Ported benchmark route:
  `/Users/derekwong/efficio-orbit/apps/docs/app/design-system/benchmarks/lovable-port/page.tsx`
- Ported benchmark component:
  `/Users/derekwong/efficio-orbit/apps/docs/app/design-system/benchmarks/lovable-port/LovablePortBenchmark.tsx`

## Benchmark Screenshot Evidence
Use these screenshots for benchmark-route evidence of Lovable/ShadCN-to-Orbit
translation, table controls, tabs, density controls, and theme coverage. Do not treat
them as canonical platform visual precedent until current product screenshots are linked:

## Source-Backed Shape
The original prototype used ShadCN `Button`, `Input`, `Badge`, `Avatar`, dropdown menu
checkboxes, lucide icons, Tailwind classes, raw OKLCH theme variables, pixel column
widths, and a virtualized div-table for a 623-row AUT01 initiatives workflow.

The port maps that structure to Orbit:
- `PageHeader` for the project header and section tabs.
- `Searchbox` for initiative search.
- `Dropdown` for status, stage, and column-set controls.
- `Button` groups with `aria-pressed` for scope, state preview, and density.
- `Table` for native table semantics, sorting, row selection, pagination, empty state,
  and compact density.
- `Badge` for status, stage, active filters, and savings variance.
- `Card` for selected detail, permission, loading/error, and recovery states.
- `Text`, `Headings`, and `FaIcon` for Orbit typography and icons.

## Acceptance Notes
Future ports should keep useful product information architecture, not prototype styling.
Always produce a report with component mapping, token translation, missing states added,
accessibility fixes, deviations, commands, browser checks, and open brain updates.
Loading previews should keep the active table density and visible column set so the
state does not shift the user's scanning context.
Repeated row actions such as "View" and "Edit" need row-specific accessible names.
Resource initials or other compact abbreviations should carry full hidden text in the
cell instead of depending on `aria-label` on a generic span.

The port may substitute an approved Orbit composition for a missing prototype feature,
but the substitution must be explicit. In this benchmark, granular dropdown checkbox
column toggles became column-set presets because Orbit does not yet have a contracted
menu/checkbox-list pattern.

## Known Limits
- This is a docs benchmark route, not a production AUT01 initiatives screen.
- Browser visual accessibility and benchmark screenshot artifacts are linked; manual
  screen-reader confirmation remains separate.
- Resource initials are page-local because no Avatar/resource-stack contract exists.
- Large-table virtualization was replaced with pagination because Orbit `Table` has no
  source-backed virtualization contract.

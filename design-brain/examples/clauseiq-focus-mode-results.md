# Golden Example: ClauseIQ Guided Results Workflow

## Demonstrates
- Source-backed ClauseIQ workflow using Orbit components.
- Guided conversational workflow pattern.
- Modal initiative selection with search, ownership toggle, and selectable table.
- Upload validation, processing state, and results state.
- Result actions and next-step actions after analysis completes.

## Real Source Links
- Prototype implementation:
  `/Users/derekwong/efficio-orbit/apps/prototypes/components/feature/clauseiq/ClauseIQPrototype.tsx`
- Prototype state reducer:
  `/Users/derekwong/efficio-orbit/apps/prototypes/components/feature/clauseiq/state.ts`
- Prototype data:
  `/Users/derekwong/efficio-orbit/apps/prototypes/data/clauseiq-mock.ts`
- Upload validation:
  `/Users/derekwong/efficio-orbit/apps/prototypes/components/feature/clauseiq/upload.ts`
- Prototype tests:
  `/Users/derekwong/efficio-orbit/apps/prototypes/components/feature/clauseiq/ClauseIQPrototype.test.tsx`
- Results benchmark:
  `/Users/derekwong/efficio-orbit/apps/docs/app/design-system/benchmarks/clauseiq-results/ClauseIQResultsBenchmark.tsx`
- Benchmark screenshot reference pack:
  `_benchmarks/results/2026-06-15-golden-visual-reference.md`

## Benchmark Screenshot Evidence
Use these screenshots for benchmark-route evidence of the ClauseIQ results-table shape
across Efficio/Orbit themes and default/compact density. Do not treat them as canonical
platform visual precedent until current ClauseIQ product screenshots are linked:

## Source-Backed Shape
ClauseIQ renders inside `OrbitAppShell` with a `PageHeader`, then moves through these
states:
1. Welcome.
2. Select initiative.
3. Select analysis parameter.
4. Upload contract.
5. Processing.
6. Results.

The results card includes:
- `Chip` label `Analysis Result`.
- timestamp.
- heading `Here is your Analysis Result`.
- `Toggle` for `Save To My Documents`.
- file upload status line.
- reviewed-clause status line.
- summary copy.
- severity chips for missing/high/medium/low deviation counts.
- primary `View Result` action.
- secondary `Run Another Analysis` and `Download Report` actions.
- `ToolNextStepsCard` with next actions after the result.

The tests verify the core flow, keyboard initiative selection, upload validation,
processing-to-results transition, next-step actions, preserved previous analysis when
running another analysis, and absence of console warnings/errors through the core flow.

## Acceptance Notes
Use this as the current precedent for Orbit AI-assisted workflows. It is not a pure
focus-mode results page; it is a guided workflow that ends in a results card. For dense
review screens with persistent result table plus detail panel, use
`design-brain/patterns/focus-mode-results.md` and keep it marked as needing a stronger
product source.

## Known Limits
- No production product screenshot is linked yet; the available screenshots are docs
  benchmark captures.
- The prototype uses mock data.
- MarketIQ and RFP Analytics examples are still missing.
- A dedicated focus-mode results screen has not been linked yet.

# Platform Profile: Orbit / Client Connected Platform

## Audience

External client users: procurement, category, sourcing, legal, and stakeholder teams
using client-facing Efficio workflows.

## Product Intent

Orbit / Client Connected Platform should feel client-safe, guided, trustworthy, and
polished while preserving enterprise density. It needs clearer context, safer copy, and
more explicit permission/review states than internal-only tooling.

## Visual Truth

User-provided screenshots are now listed in the manifest and are the first Orbit /
Client Connected Platform visual truth candidates. Treat them as restricted until
design-system owners confirm sanitization and approval. Do not treat docs benchmark
screenshots as Orbit / Client Connected Platform visual precedent.

Screenshot manifest:
`design-brain/examples/screenshots/orbit-client-connected-platform/manifest.md`

Visual truth extraction note:
`design-brain/platforms/orbit-client-connected-platform-visual-truth.md`

When designing or reviewing an Orbit / Client Connected Platform screen, read the visual
truth note before applying page-level layout, density, shell, table/list, modal,
dashboard, tool-hub, workflow, or copy patterns.

## Copy Rules

- Use client-safe language. Avoid internal Efficio shorthand unless product source
  proves the client sees it.
- Explain state, next action, and recovery clearly.
- Permission/RBAC copy should be respectful and action-oriented, not operationally
  revealing.

## Pattern Preferences

- Shell/navigation: use current client platform screenshots or source before composing
  new shell patterns.
- Density: keep tables and dashboards scannable, but favor clearer grouping and guidance
  than internal CP screens.
- Tables/list-detail: preserve context and review confidence; row actions must be
  explicit and client-safe.
- Dashboards/KPIs: pair summary metrics with accessible explanation and underlying rows.
- RBAC/permissions: state what the user can do and who can help without leaking internal
  operations.

- Analytics/KPI views: `design-brain/patterns/analytics-dashboard.md`
- Generated output and next actions: `design-brain/patterns/review-and-approve-workflow.md`

## Difference From Connected Platform

- Orbit / Client Connected Platform needs clearer guidance, safer copy, and more visible
  selected context than internal CP.
- Orbit should not inherit CP's internal shorthand, operational shortcuts, or dense
  controls unless source proves clients see them.
- Orbit screens may still be data-dense, but they should preserve client confidence,
  review clarity, and explicit next actions.

## Known Gaps

- Screenshot sanitization and design-system approval are still needed.
- Client-facing form/error examples are still needed.
- Platform-specific pattern contracts still need to be connected to the approved visual
  truth set.

# Platform Profile: Connected Platform

## Audience

Internal Efficio users: consultants, operators, administrators, and delivery teams using
Efficio-owned workflows.

## Product Intent

Connected Platform should support operational speed, power-user density, internal
administration, and repeated long-session work. It may expose more operational detail
than client-facing Orbit screens, as long as hierarchy remains scannable.

## Visual Truth

User-provided screenshots are now listed in the manifest and are the first Connected
Platform visual truth candidates. Treat them as restricted until design-system owners
confirm sanitization and approval. Do not treat docs benchmark screenshots as Connected
Platform visual precedent.

Screenshot manifest:
`design-brain/examples/screenshots/connected-platform/manifest.md`

Visual truth extraction note:
`design-brain/platforms/connected-platform-visual-truth.md`

When designing or reviewing a Connected Platform screen, read the visual truth note
before applying page-level layout, density, shell, table/list, modal, dashboard, or copy
patterns.

## Copy Rules

- Internal terminology is allowed when it reflects real Efficio operations.
- Prefer concise operational labels over client-facing explanation.
- Error and permission copy may reference internal roles or operational state when safe.

## Pattern Preferences

- Shell/navigation: use current Connected Platform screenshots or source before
  composing new shell patterns.
- Density: default to comfortable with compact support for tables, queues, and
  administration screens.
- Tables/list-detail: preserve high scan density, stable filters, row identity, and
  recoverable actions.
- Dashboards/KPIs: prioritize operational signal, exception handling, and drill-down.
- RBAC/permissions: show internal reason and recovery path when it is safe to disclose.

## Golden Examples

Read the nearest platform-matched example before creating or reviewing a Connected
Platform screen:

- `design-brain/examples/connected-platform-home-shell-dashboard.md`
- `design-brain/examples/connected-platform-initiative-list-table.md`
- `design-brain/examples/connected-platform-clauseiq-contract-wizard-modal.md`
- `design-brain/examples/connected-platform-supplier-tracker-table.md`

## Relevant Pattern Contracts

- Home/dashboard surfaces: `design-brain/patterns/home-dashboard.md`
- Dense initiative or supplier lists: `design-brain/patterns/list-detail.md`
- Multi-step setup/upload modals: `design-brain/patterns/config-wizard.md`

## Difference From Orbit / Client Connected Platform

- Connected Platform can expose more operational metadata, internal process labels, and
  dense controls.
- Connected Platform should not inherit Orbit's extra explanatory framing when that slows
  internal power users down.
- Connected Platform screens may prioritize immediate action, bulk operations, and
  operational scanning over client reassurance.

## Known Gaps

- Screenshot sanitization and design-system approval are still needed.
- Settings/admin examples are still needed.
- Platform-specific pattern contracts still need to be connected to the approved visual
  truth set.

# Pattern Contract: `focus-mode-results`

## Purpose & Precedent
Deep results review pattern for dense outputs where users compare, inspect, and act on
findings without losing context.

## Source Status
This pattern now has benchmark evidence but not yet production product evidence. The
ClauseIQ prototype is a guided workflow that ends in a results card; the newer benchmark
route demonstrates a fuller focus-mode results table with persistent filters, result
table, state controls, compact density, and detail dialog. Keep this `in-review` until a
real production/product screen is linked.

Benchmark evidence:
`/Users/derekwong/efficio-orbit/apps/docs/app/design-system/benchmarks/clauseiq-results/ClauseIQResultsBenchmark.tsx`

## When To Use / When Not To
Use for results dashboards, clause findings, analysis results, and review work where a
table/list and detail view must stay connected. Do not use for lightweight summaries or
linear setup flows.

## Regions & Composition
Header/status bar, filter rail or toolbar, results table/list, detail drawer/panel,
review actions, stale/refresh indicator.

Component contracts: `data-table`, `button`, `tabs`, `badge-status`, `dialog` or future
`drawer`, `toast-notification`, `card-panel`.

## Hierarchy & Density
Users scan result count, filters, highest-priority rows, then detail. Default
comfortable density is acceptable for review; compact density is required for
high-row-count work.

## Page-Level States
Initial skeleton, partial data, zero results, failed load, stale/refreshing,
long-running analysis, permission-limited actions.

## Navigation & Focus Behaviour
Keyboard enters filters, results, row actions, then detail. Closing detail returns focus
to the originating row. If a modal is used instead of a future drawer, it must follow
the `dialog` contract.

## Responsive Behaviour
On narrow screens, filters collapse into a controlled panel and detail becomes
full-width. The result count and active filters remain visible.

## Data & Performance Notes
Use pagination or virtualisation for large result sets. Avoid reflow when results load.

## Anti-Patterns
- Filters hidden only in a modal for desktop workflows.
- Cards replacing a dense result table.
- Blank chart/table while loading instead of final-layout skeleton.
- Treating ClauseIQ's current results card as the whole focus-mode precedent.

## Golden Example
`design-brain/examples/data-table-dense.md` now links the ClauseIQ results benchmark.
`design-brain/examples/clauseiq-focus-mode-results.md` remains adjacent guided-workflow
evidence.

## Gap Report
- Major: link a real focus-mode product screen before marking this stable.
- Major: exact responsive behavior must be validated against product precedent.
- Major: reusable drawer/detail-panel source is missing.

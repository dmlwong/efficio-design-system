# Pattern Contract: `analytics-dashboard`

## Purpose & Precedent
Summarize procurement analytics while preserving access to underlying rows and clear
decision context.

Benchmark precedent:
`/Users/derekwong/efficio-orbit/apps/docs/app/design-system/benchmarks/analytics-dashboard/MarketIQAnalyticsDashboardBenchmark.tsx`

Adjacent Orbit / Client Connected Platform dashboard visual precedent:
`design-brain/examples/orbit-client-home-ai-tools-dashboard.md`

## When To Use / When Not To
Use when the user compares KPIs, trends, categories, or supplier/project performance.
Do not use charts when a dense table answers the question better. Use `home-dashboard`
instead when the page is a platform home surface rather than a deep analytics view.

## Regions & Composition
Filter/state bar, KPI row, trend chart, category comparison, insight/status region,
underlying table, export or drill-down actions. For client-facing dashboards, preserve
clear context about what the metric means and where the user can inspect the underlying
rows.

Component contracts: `card-panel`, `data-table`, `button`, `select-combobox`,
`badge-status`.

## Hierarchy & Density
Number first, delta second, chart third, underlying rows always reachable.

## Page-Level States
Initial skeleton, insufficient data, partial data, chart/table load failure, stale data,
refreshing, refreshed, permission-limited export.

## Navigation & Focus Behaviour
Filters/state controls precede KPIs. Charts expose data outside hover through a visible
summary and underlying table. The underlying table remains keyboard reachable and
sortable.

KPI deltas and table movement values must pass AA contrast at `--orbit-text-xs` in both
themes. Do not rely on green/warning colour alone; keep the sign, direction icon, and
visible delta copy.

## Responsive Behaviour
KPI cards stack only when needed. Charts keep readable labels or switch to table-first.
Compact mode tightens page gaps and should pass compact density to the underlying table.

## Data & Performance Notes
No misleading axes. Consistent scales across compared charts. Use semantic data-viz
tokens once available; until then use existing Orbit semantic/status tokens and document
the gap in `data-viz.md`.

## Anti-Patterns
- Default chart library colors/tooltips.
- Dual-axis or decorative charts.
- Hiding data rows behind hover-only interactions.
- Stale data shown only through colour.
- Loading charts that reflow into a different final layout.

## Golden Example
- `design-brain/examples/analytics-kpi-chart.md`
- Adjacent client dashboard visual truth:
  `design-brain/examples/orbit-client-home-ai-tools-dashboard.md`

## Gap Report
- Major: real MarketIQ / RFP Analytics production screen source has not been linked.
- Major: real data-viz token names are missing.
- Minor: Orbit home dashboard screenshot is adjacent dashboard precedent, not a deep
  analytics-chart source.
- Minor: browser visual contrast evidence exists for the benchmark route, but no axe or
  manual screen-reader artifact has been captured yet.

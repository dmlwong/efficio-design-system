# Pattern Contract: `lovable-port`

## Purpose & Precedent
Use this pattern when a Lovable, ShadCN, Tailwind, v0, Bolt, or other AI-generated
prototype needs to become Orbit-compliant product UI.

Current benchmark precedent:
`/Users/derekwong/efficio-orbit/apps/docs/app/design-system/benchmarks/lovable-port/LovablePortBenchmark.tsx`

Original source prototype:
`/Users/derekwong/Downloads/Test`

## When To Use / When Not To
Use when the prototype has useful product structure, interaction ideas, or domain
content but does not yet use Orbit components, semantic tokens, full states, or
accessibility behavior.

Do not use this as permission to import prototype UI wholesale. If the prototype is only
visual inspiration with no useful workflow structure, rebuild from the closest Orbit
component and page-pattern contracts instead.

## Regions & Composition
Required porting regions:
- Source inventory: source files, routes, component imports, token/theme files.
- Component mapping: imported element to Orbit component/contract.
- Token translation: raw Tailwind/ShadCN/OKLCH/pixel/rem values to Orbit tokens.
- State completion: loading, empty, error, disabled/permission, active filters, and
  selected-detail states added around the useful workflow.
- Theme and density verification: Efficio base and Orbit theme, comfortable and compact.
- Deviation report: approved substitutions and gaps that need design-system decisions.

Core contracts commonly used:
`data-table`, `button`, `input`, `select-combobox`, `tabs`, `badge-status`,
`card-panel`, `dialog` when detail/recovery needs modal behavior.

## Hierarchy & Density
Preserve the prototype's useful information architecture, but let Orbit decide the
visual system. In the benchmark, the AUT01 project header, section tabs, scope filters,
search, status/stage filters, column view, table, and row detail were preserved; visual
styling, state handling, and accessibility moved to Orbit.

Default to comfortable density and provide compact density for dense tables and lists.

## Page-Level States
Every port must add states that the prototype skipped:
- Loading state matching final layout shape, current columns, and current density.
- Empty state with recovery guidance.
- Error state with retry or clear next action.
- Disabled or no-permission state with visible reason.
- Active filters and clear action.
- Selected-row/detail state where row interaction exists.
- Theme and density states.

## Navigation & Focus Behaviour
Replace click-only prototype interactions with Orbit keyboard-operable controls.
Use named search regions, named tables, explicit row-selection labels, `aria-pressed`
for toggle groups, `role="status"` for loading, and `role="alert"` for errors.
When using `PageHeader` tabs, ensure every `panelId` referenced by a tab exists in the
mounted DOM, even if inactive panels are mounted as hidden empty panels.
Row-local actions such as "View" or "Edit" must include the row identity in their
accessible names.

Status and stage values must be visible text, not only colour dots.
When compact visual initials or badges abbreviate people/resources, include the full
text in a visually hidden node inside the same cell rather than relying on `aria-label`
on a generic non-interactive element.

## Responsive Behaviour
The port must pass mobile-width sanity checks without page-level horizontal overflow.
Wide tables may scroll inside their own table region, but controls, filter summaries,
and recovery states must wrap without clipping.

## Data & Performance Notes
The current Orbit `Table` contract supports pagination, not virtualization. If a
prototype uses virtualized div rows, prefer Orbit `Table` with pagination or
server-side pagination unless a virtual-table contract exists.

Do not preserve raw pixel column widths. Translate width needs to token expressions or
let the Orbit component determine intrinsic layout.

## Anti-Patterns
- Importing ShadCN/Tailwind components into Orbit because they are already present in
  the prototype.
- Recreating a pseudo-table with divs, clickable headers, colour-only status dots, or
  hover-only actions.
- Keeping raw OKLCH theme values, pixel column widths, rem sizing, or hardcoded icon
  sizes.
- Treating missing component contracts as silent local implementation details.
- Omitting permission, loading, empty, and error states because the prototype did.

## Golden Example
`design-brain/examples/lovable-initiatives-port.md`

## Gap Report
- Major: no contracted menu/checkbox-list pattern exists for granular column visibility.
- Major: no Avatar/resource-stack contract exists yet.
- Major: no source-backed virtual-table contract exists yet.
- Major: no formal axe/contrast artifact has been captured for the benchmark route.

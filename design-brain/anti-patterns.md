# anti-patterns.md — Never do this

The cheapest way to lift output quality. Read before building; cite in every contract.

## Visual / system
- ❌ Shipping the untouched ShadCN / Tailwind default look. This is the #1 failure mode.
- ❌ Importing a Lovable/ShadCN prototype as-is instead of mapping it to Orbit
  components, tokens, states, and accessibility behaviour.
- ❌ Hardcoded colours, spacing, radii, shadows, font sizes — anything not a token.
- ❌ Reaching past semantic tokens to primitives or raw values.
- ❌ Theme-conditional logic inside components (`if theme === 'orbit'`).
- ❌ Inconsistent spacing rhythm; one-off margins that ignore the scale.
- ❌ Consumer-grade whitespace on data-dense enterprise views.
- ❌ Treating docs benchmark screenshots as canonical product visual direction when
  they do not match the current live platform.
- ❌ Mixing internal Connected Platform visual patterns, terminology, or shell behavior
  into external Orbit / Client Connected Platform screens.
- ❌ Using client-facing Orbit polish to hide operational controls that internal
  Connected Platform power users need.
- ❌ Treating a reference diagram as a product UI precedent. The procurement technology
  landscape image is context only, not a layout source.

## Platform mixing
- ❌ Designing before identifying the platform: Connected Platform or Orbit / Client
  Connected Platform.
- ❌ Borrowing Connected Platform's internal shortcuts, operational labels, or dense
  admin controls for external Orbit users without source evidence.
- ❌ Borrowing Orbit's extra guidance, polished tool-intro framing, or client-safe copy
  for internal Connected Platform workflows when it slows power-user work.
- ❌ Using Connected Platform screenshot evidence to justify Orbit shell/navigation
  choices, or the reverse.
- ❌ Treating in-review/restricted screenshots as public marketing assets. They may
  inform internal design guidance, but they still require sanitization and approval.
- ❌ Copying browser chrome, OS dock, toasts from test tooling, or screenshot capture
  artifacts into design decisions.
- ❌ Flattening client workflow screens into generic feature-card landing pages. Orbit
  cards must map to real tools, selected context, reports, next actions, or evidence.
- ❌ Simplifying internal operational screens into sparse client-friendly flows when
  the source workflow needs tables, filters, bulk actions, status controls, or owner
  metadata.

## States & behaviour
- ❌ Building only the happy path; omitting loading / empty / error / disabled.
- ❌ Recreating dense tables with clickable div rows, colour-only dots, or raw
  virtualized row markup when the Orbit `Table` contract covers the current need.
- ❌ Layout that jumps when data loads or an error appears.
- ❌ Fake instant success that hides real async state.
- ❌ Ignoring RBAC / permission states.

## Accessibility
- ❌ Removing focus outlines without an equivalent visible focus style.
- ❌ Colour as the only signal (e.g. red text with no icon/label).
- ❌ Click-only interactions with no keyboard path.
- ❌ Contrast below WCAG 2.2 AA.

## Motion & copy
- ❌ Decorative animation that slows scanning or repeats on every render.
- ❌ Ignoring `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- ❌ Vague or jokey microcopy in error/empty states (see `ux-copy.md`).

## Process
- ❌ Building a system component with no contract.
- ❌ Changing a component's public API without updating its contract first.
- ❌ Silently resolving a conflict with `AGENTS.md` instead of asking.

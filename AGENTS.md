# AGENTS.md — Orbit Design Brain

> Canonical, always-on design context for any AI coding agent working on Orbit.
> This file is the single source of truth. Claude Code imports it via `@AGENTS.md`
> in `CLAUDE.md`. Codex reads it directly. Lovable consumes the compiled projection
> in `lovable/knowledge-base.md`. Edit here, project everywhere — never the reverse.

> Canonical home: this file lives in the shared **Orbit Design Brain** Obsidian vault.
> Product-repo copies are generated exports. Do not hand-edit exported copies.

## 1. Who you are building for

You are generating UI for Efficio procurement platforms:

- **Connected Platform** — internal Efficio users.
- **Orbit / Client Connected Platform** — external client users.

Surfaces include **ClauseIQ**, **MarketIQ**, **RFP Analytics**, and **RFP Builder**.
The audience is procurement and category professionals doing dense, high-stakes,
repetitive work inside long sessions.

This is **B2B enterprise software**, not a consumer app and not a marketing site.
That single fact governs almost every decision below: information density over
whitespace, scannability over delight, predictability over novelty.

## 2. Non-negotiable rules (apply to every output, every time)

1. **Tokens only.** Never hardcode a colour, spacing, radius, font size, shadow, or
   z-index value. Every visual value resolves through the token system. A hardcoded
   value is a defect, not a style choice. See `design-brain/tokens.md`.
2. **Identify the platform first.** Before designing a screen, identify whether it is
   for Connected Platform or Orbit / Client Connected Platform. Read the matching
   platform profile and visual truth note in `design-brain/platforms/`. If the platform
   is unclear, ask before creating UI.
3. **Match the right platform, not the default.** Do **not** ship the generic ShadCN / Tailwind
   default look. The model's untouched aesthetic is the single biggest quality risk.
   When unsure what the platform looks like, read current product screenshots,
   Storybook, the relevant platform profile, or a source-backed golden example before
   inventing. Benchmark screenshots are useful for behavior, state, theme, and density
   evidence, but they are not canonical platform visual precedent unless design-system
   owners mark them as such.
4. **WCAG 2.2 AA is the floor, not the goal.** Contrast, focus order, keyboard
   operability, and visible focus rings are required on every interactive element.
   See `design-brain/accessibility.md`.
5. **Density is a first-class concern.** Default to the comfortable density mode;
   support compact. Tables, lists, and forms are where Orbit lives — they must stay
   legible at high row counts. See `design-brain/principles.md`.
6. **Use the contract, not your imagination.** Before building any component that
   exists in the system, read its contract in `design-brain/components/`. If no contract exists,
   propose one using `design-brain/components/_TEMPLATE.md` before writing code.
7. **Respect state and role.** Every component must define loading, empty, error,
   and disabled states, plus any RBAC-driven variations, before it is considered done.
8. **Stop and ask** when a request conflicts with these rules rather than silently
   resolving the conflict.

## 3. How to load the rest of the brain (progressive disclosure)

Keep this file lean. Pull the detailed layer in only when the task needs it:

All paths are relative to the repo root.

| When the task involves…            | Read first                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Any screen/page design             | `design-brain/platforms/<platform>.md` and its visual truth note |
| Any visual value                   | `design-brain/tokens.md`                          |
| The intent / feel of a screen      | `design-brain/principles.md`                      |
| Building or editing a component    | `design-brain/components/<name>.md` (its contract)|
| A component with no contract yet   | `design-brain/components/_TEMPLATE.md`            |
| A full page / multi-component view | `design-brain/patterns/<name>.md` (page patterns) |
| Charts, KPIs, analytics views      | `design-brain/data-viz.md`                        |
| Animation, transitions, micro-int. | `design-brain/motion.md`                          |
| Any text shown to a user           | `design-brain/ux-copy.md`                         |
| Anything interactive               | `design-brain/accessibility.md`                   |
| "Why does the output look generic" | `design-brain/anti-patterns.md`                   |
| Porting a Lovable/external proto   | `design-brain/skills/port-to-orbit/SKILL.md`      |
| Writing a contract from source     | `design-brain/skills/extract-contract/SKILL.md`   |
| Reviewing finished UI work         | `design-brain/agents/design-reviewer.md`          |

## 4. Token contract (summary — full detail in `design-brain/tokens.md`)

Three tiers, two themes:

- **Tier 1 — Primitives**: raw palette/scale values in
  `/Users/derekwong/efficio-orbit/packages/orbit/styles/tokens/`.
- **Tier 2 — Semantic**: real families such as `--orbit-color-text-primary`,
  `--orbit-color-border-focused`, and `--orbit-color-bg-hover`.
- **Tier 3 — Component**: component-scoped tokens such as
  `--orbit-color-btn-primary-*`, `--orbit-color-card-bg-*`,
  `--orbit-dropdown-trigger-height`, and `--orbit-tab-height`.
- **Themes**: `efficio` / Connected Platform base on `:root`; `orbit` through
  `[data-theme="orbit"]` in `themes/orbit.css`. Components must switch through token
  values, not theme-conditional component logic.

Use `npm run audit:design-system` in `/Users/derekwong/efficio-orbit` to catch
hardcoded visual values and other design-system rule violations.

## 5. Definition of done for any UI work

A component or screen is done only when **all** are true:

- [ ] Zero hardcoded visual values; everything via tokens
- [ ] Platform identified and matching platform profile followed
- [ ] Renders correctly in both `efficio` and `orbit` themes
- [ ] All states present: default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, empty, error
- [ ] Keyboard-operable with a visible focus ring; meets WCAG 2.2 AA contrast
- [ ] Benchmark routes include generated accessibility, browser visual, and
      screen-reader artifacts
- [ ] Works at comfortable **and** compact density
- [ ] Copy follows `design-brain/ux-copy.md`; motion follows `design-brain/motion.md`
- [ ] Matches the component contract (or a new contract was written first)
- [ ] No `design-brain/anti-patterns.md` violations

## 6. Feedback loop

When you make an incorrect assumption about Orbit and the user corrects you, **update
the relevant brain file so the fix persists**, then continue. Treat this file and its
references as living memory, not static docs. Propose the edit; let the user approve.

## 7. Governance

Design system owners approve changes to this file, `design-brain/tokens.md`,
component contracts, pattern contracts, and tool projections. Product and design team
members may propose changes using `_review/Change Request Template.md`.
